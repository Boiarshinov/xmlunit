XMLUnit 2.x
===========

XMLUnit 2.x is a complete rewrite of XMLUnit and actually doesn't
share any code with XMLUnit for Java 1.x.

Some goals for XMLUnit 2.x:

* create .NET and Java versions that are compatible in design while
  trying to be idiomatic for each platform
* remove all static configuration (the old XMLUnit class setter methods)
* focus on the parts that are useful for testing
  - XPath
  - (Schema) validation
  - comparisons
* be independent of any test framework

Build Status XMLUnit 2.x for Java: [![Build Status XMLUnit 2.x for Java](https://travis-ci.org/xmlunit/xmlunit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xmlunit/xmlunit)

This will be a work in progress for quite some time.  We are in the
process of migrating the - unpublished so far - XMLUnit 2.x from
sourceforge to github.  XMLUnit 1.x for Java and 0.x for .NET will
stay at sourceforge.
