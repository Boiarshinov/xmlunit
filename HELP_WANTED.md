We Need Your Help!
==================

This page lists a few things that should be done before XMLUnit 2.x
can be relased in a more or less random order.  It is not exhaustive
at all and if you want to work on something that is not on this list,
that's absolutely fine - maybe drop us a line on the XMLUnit general
list so we can avoid duplicate or wasted effort.

In General
----------

* work on the open issues

Java
----

* additional hamcrest matchers

.NET
----

* additional NUnit constraints
* build ISource from objects via XmlSerializer
