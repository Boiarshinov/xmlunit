We Need Your Help!
==================

This page lists a few things that should be done before XMLUnit 2.x
can be relased in a more or less random order.  It is not exhaustive
at all and if you want to work on something that is not on this list,
that's absolutely fine - maybe drop us a line on the XMLUnit general
list so we can avoid duplicate or wasted effort.

In General
----------

* provide a User's Guide - at least a first sketch that explains how
  to use parts of the API - [here](https://github.com/xmlunit/user-guide/wiki)
* Validate the API - this is paramount to get 2.0 final out but should
  probably be complete before the first alpha release
* work on the open issues
* provide convenient APIs for ignoring complete subtrees (see
  [#26](https://github.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/26))
  when comparing pieces of XML.

Java
----

* additional hamcrest matchers

.NET
----

* additional NUnit constraints
* build ISource from objects via XmlSerializer
