    <a href="https://www.xmlunit.org/">XMLUnit</a> helps testing code
    that creates XML.

    <p>XMLUnit for Java is separated into several jars:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>xmlunit-core</code> contains all algorithms and
        classes needed to validate XML, perform XPath queries or
        compare two pieces of XML.</li>
      <li><code>xmlunit-matchers</code>
        contains <a href="http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/">Hamcrest</a>
        matchers on top of <code>xmlunit-core</code>. While the code
        is compiled against Hamcrest 1.x the resulting artifact is
        supposed to work with Hamcrest 2.x as well.</li>
      <li><code>xmlunit-assertj</code>
        contains <a href="https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/index.html">AssertJ</a>
        assertions on top of <code>xmlunit-core</code> that work with
        AssertJ 2.x and 3.x.</li>
      <li><code>xmlunit-assertj3</code>
        contains <a href="https://assertj.github.io/doc/">AssertJ
        3.x</a> assertions on top of <code>xmlunit-core</code> that
        work with AssertJ 3.18.1 and later.</li>
      <li><code>xmlunit-placeholders</code> - an experimental component that uses an extensible DSL inside of the
          control document to simplify certain special cases for comparisons.</li>
      <li><code>xmlunit-jakarta-jaxb-impl</code> provides a JAXB {@code Input} builder that uses version 3.x
          of <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/xml-binding/">Jakarta XML Binding</a> rather than it predecessor
          that uses the {@code javax.xml.bind} package (and is supported by <code>xmlunit-core</code> directly).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While XMLUnit is focussed on testing, parts of it may be useful
      in different contexts as well.  The {@link
      org.xmlunit.diff.DifferenceEngine} may be the driver behind a
      visual XML diff tool for example.</p>

    <p>The main use case of XMLUnit is comparing XML generated by the
      code under test with some known source of "good XML".  This is
      the responsibility of the {@link
      org.xmlunit.diff.DifferenceEngine} and its main (currently sole)
      implementation {@link org.xmlunit.diff.DOMDifferenceEngine}.</p>

    <p>Sometimes a full comparison is more than is needed in which
      case only parts of the generated document are validated using
      XPaths.  This is the responsibility of {@link
      org.xmlunit.xpath.XPathEngine} and its implementation {@link
      org.xmlunit.xpath.JAXPXPathEngine}.</p>

    <p>The <a href="org/xmlunit/validation/package-summary.html">validation</a>
      package contains everything needed to validate documents against
      XML Schema (or even the schema document itself) or a DTD.  Based
      of JAXP's validation package the {@link
      org.xmlunit.validation.JAXPValidator} class should be able to
      validate against different schema languages as well if you
      provided it with the needed implementations.</p>

    <p>The <a href="org/xmlunit/builder/package-summary.html">builder</a>
      package contains fluent builders that may provide an API that is
      more convenient to use in many cases.</p>

    <p><code>xmlunit-legacy</code> provides an API
      compatible to XMLUnit for Java 1.x that is implemented on top of
      XMLUnit Core.</p>

    <p>XMLUnit for Java 2.6.0 adds a new experimental
      component <code>xmlunit-placeholders</code> that aims to provide
      a small DSL for configuring the test engine via the control XML
      document rather than code. The initial code base only supports a
      placeholder of <code>${xmlunit.ignore}</code> to be used in
      order to make XMLUnit ignore the element containing this
      sequence.</p>
